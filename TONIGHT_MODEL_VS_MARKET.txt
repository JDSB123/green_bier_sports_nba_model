SUMMARY BY MARKET
================================================================================

FG SPREAD:     3 picks <-- OPTIMIZED MARKET (v20: 1 pick, v21: 3 picks = +200%)
FG TOTAL:      3 picks
1H SPREAD:     4 picks

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS - MODEL vs MARKET
================================================================================

BIGGEST EDGES (Where model disagrees most with market):

1. UNDER 241.0 (Pelicans/Pacers FG Total)
   - Model: 228.8, Market: 241.0
   - Difference: 12.2 points
   - Market overvaluing total

2. UNDER 124.5 (Pelicans/Pacers 1H Total)
   - Model: 114.0, Market: 124.5
   - Difference: 10.5 points
   - Market overvaluing total

3. UNDER 119.75 (Wizards/Kings 1H Total)
   - Model: 111.4, Market: 119.75
   - Difference: 8.3 points
   - Market overvaluing total

TREND: Heavy UNDER bias on totals - model thinks market is setting lines too high


SPREAD VALUE:

Timberwolves FG Spread (OPTIMIZED MARKET):
- Model: Timberwolves -3.2 (favored)
- Market: Timberwolves +4.5 (underdog)
- Difference: 7.7 points
- Massive value on Timberwolves getting points when model says they should be favored


CONFIDENCE LEVELS:

High Confidence (75%+):
- All 1H Spreads: 77% confidence
- 76ers, Kings, Timberwolves, Bulls all show 77%

Medium-High Confidence (65-74%):
- 1H Totals: 68-72%
- FG Totals: 67%

Medium Confidence (60-64%):
- FG Spreads: 64%
- Some FG Totals: 61%


================================================================================
OPTIMIZATION IMPACT
================================================================================

With v33.0.20.0 thresholds (0.62 conf, 2.0 edge on FG Spread):
- Would have picked: 1 FG Spread pick
- Would have picked: 9 total picks

With v33.0.21.0 thresholds (0.55 conf, 0.0 edge on FG Spread):
- Actually picked: 3 FG Spread picks (+200%)
- Actually picked: 14 total picks (+55%)

ADDITIONAL VALUE CAPTURED:
- 2 more FG Spread picks (Pelicans +4.5, Wizards +7.0)
- These passed the lowered threshold and added value to portfolio

Note: Tonight only has 6 games. On typical 10-12 game slates, expect:
- FG Spread: 5-10 picks (vs 2-3 with v20)
- Total: 20-30 picks (vs 15-20 with v20)
