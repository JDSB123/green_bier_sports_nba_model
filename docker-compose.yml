# NBA v5.0 BETA - Production Docker Compose
#
# ⚠️  DEPRECATED: This multi-service compose file has been replaced by a single-container production image.
#
# For production use, run:
#   ./run.ps1
#
# This builds and runs the hardened `nba-strict-api` Docker image with all models baked-in.
# No postgres/redis/microservices required.
#
# The archived multi-service compose is available in DEPRECATED_docker-compose/ for reference.
#
# For backtesting (development), use:
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.backtest.yml up backtest-full

# This file is kept for backwards compatibility but should not be used for production.
# See DEPRECATED_docker-compose/docker-compose.yml for the original multi-service configuration.
