%% Relationships
svc-nba-picks-api --> |"hosted on"| containerapp_nba-picks-api
containerapp_nba-picks-api -.-> |"user-identity"| keyvault_secrets-store
```

- The `nba-picks-api` service runs in Azure Container Apps.
- The container pulls its image from Azure Container Registry and reads required secrets from Azure Key Vault via a user-managed identity.
- Logs and metrics should be configured to flow to Log Analytics and Application Insights for observability.
